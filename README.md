## 👋 About Me

I'm Wissam — a systems-first engineer focused on building reliable, intelligent, and resilient backend infrastructure. I specialize in cloud-native environments, automation pipelines, and the orchestration of distributed systems.

Lately, I’ve been designing an experimental AI-powered framework that merges automation, memory, and modularity — aiming to build tools that *work with you*, not just for you.
